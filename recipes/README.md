How to run the code --

First we need to start the simple server:
    ./server.sh

The main visualization is listed under:
    ~/visualization/index.html

If you open up that page on localhost:8888/visualization you'll be able to see our visualization.

Thanks for checking out our project :-) Enjoy!
